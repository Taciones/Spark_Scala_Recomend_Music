--------------------------------

Old dataset to complete steps of Recommending musics from the Audioscrobbler dataset.
From the book Advanced Analytics with Spark, 2nd Edition 2017.

With this recommender (model :ALS) system user is capable of recommend more musics based on quantity a music was played by another user.

ALS model is easy to scale and created based on collaborative filtering.


It is still ongoing work, so I still have plans to work on it.
Produce the correct validations.
Tune the model to minimize the unknown data points.
